# My Elixir Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate for new Elixir/Phoenix-based applications. It includes a fully functional authentication system, integration with Next.js and common utilities like a mailer and API routes.

## Installation

To setup this boilerplate:

- Install the boilerplate by running `make install`
- Run `make dev` to start the development servers

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check the Phoenix deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
